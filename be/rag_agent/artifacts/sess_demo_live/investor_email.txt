Subject: Follow-up: Climate Contract v3 for Acme Climate Tech

Hi Team,

I am following up on the latest version of Climate Contract v3.

Before we can move forward with the investment, we need to address the outstanding point in issue_001. Specifically, please update the document to include stricter annual reporting language as previously discussed.

Please send over the revised draft once these changes are implemented so we can finalize the next steps.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
