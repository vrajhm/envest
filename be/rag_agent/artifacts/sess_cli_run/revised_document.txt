REVISED DRAFT SUMMARY

*   **Performance Rating:** Overall Trust Score: 65 (Approved for demonstration).
*   **Carbon Emission Reductions:** Score: 75. Progress is verified for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions; however, Scope 3 emissions data is currently absent and must be integrated.
*   **Deforestation Policy:** Score: 50. Current strategy relies on carbon offsets, which introduces significant risks regarding long-term deforestation prevention.
*   **Technical Observations:** While the reporting language is positive, the draft lacks specific detail regarding Scope 3 methodologies and the technical specifics of selected offset projects.
*   **Action Items:** Supplement the report with granular data on supply chain emissions and provide verification details for all offset-based environmental claims.
