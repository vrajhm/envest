Subject: Investment Documentation Update - Scope 3 Reporting

Dear Team,

Thank you for the ongoing collaboration regarding our potential investment. To move forward with the next steps of the process, we require one specific update to the current documentation.

Please incorporate the requirements for clause_001, which establishes specific Scope 3 reporting protocols and their associated deadlines. It is important that these benchmarks are clearly outlined before the investment proceeds.

Once we have the updated draft reflecting these changes, we can finalize the remaining formalities.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
