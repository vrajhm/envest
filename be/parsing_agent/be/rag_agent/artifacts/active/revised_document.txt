To resolve **clause_001** and address the "Syntax Notes" (removing aspirational/non-committal language), you must replace verbs like "strive," "aim," "hope," and "intended" with definitive action verbs and specific deadlines.

Since you did not provide the original text of clause_001, I have prepared a **before-and-after example** of how to resolve it, followed by a **revised plain-text draft template** that incorporates a high-accountability tone.

### How to resolve clause_001:
*   **Weak (Original Style):** "We aspire to improve our trust score by implementing better data protocols and hope to see results by next year."
*   **Resolved (Accountable Style):** "We will implement the specified data protocols by October 1st to increase the trust score to 75."

### Revised Plain-Text Draft

**REPORT: Performance Improvement and Protocol Realignment**
**Current Trust Score:** 48
**Status:** Under Revision for Accountability

**[REVISED CLAUSE_001: OBJECTIVE]**
This report establishes the mandatory actions required to raise the trust score from 48 to 80. We have eliminated all aspirational language to ensure clear accountability. Management will execute the following technical upgrades and procedural changes immediately.

**SECTION 1: OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS**
1.1 Security Protocols: The engineering team will deploy the updated encryption framework by the end of Q3. This is not a goal, but a requirement for continued operations.
1.2 Data Integrity: We will conduct weekly audits of all data entry points. These audits will identify and eliminate 100% of the syntax errors previously noted.

**SECTION 2: ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES**
2.1 Metrics: Performance will be measured by bi-weekly trust score assessments. Any score under 60 by the next reporting period will trigger an immediate departmental review.
2.2 Documentation: All future reports must use active voice. Phrases such as "it is hoped" or "we are looking into" are prohibited. Instead, reports must state "we have completed" or "we will deliver by [Date]."

**SECTION 3: TIMELINE**
- Implementation Start: Immediately.
- Milestone 1: Compliance audit completion by [Insert Date].
- Final Target: Trust Score of 80 achieved by [Insert Date].

### Key Changes Made:
1.  **Eliminated Aspirational Phrases:** Removed words like "strive," "seek to," "should," and "potentially."
2.  **Resolved Clause_001:** Replaced vague "intentions" with a direct statement of "mandatory actions" and a specific target (80).
3.  **Increased Accountability:** Switched from passive voice ("it is expected") to active voice ("Management will execute," "The team will deploy").
4.  **Quantified Success:** Added specific metrics and consequences for failing to meet the trust score thresholds.

**If you provide the specific text of your original clause_001, I can rewrite that exact sentence for you.**
