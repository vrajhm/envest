Subject: Resolution of Reporting Clauses 001-005

Email:
Dear [Contact Name],

Our review of clauses 001-005 indicates a trust score of 35 due to excessive hedging and a lack of concrete timelines. To proceed, you must tighten the language to replace aspirational goals with firm commitments regarding net-zero dates and interim targets. We also require specific data collection milestones for Scope 3 emissions and mandatory requirements for supplier ESG audits. Please submit the rectified language for these clauses by [Date] for final approval.

Best regards,

[Investor Name]
