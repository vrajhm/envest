Subject: Update on GreenTech Innovations’ Sustainability Strategy and Net-Zero Roadmap

Dear Investors,

As GreenTech Innovations continues to scale, we are pleased to provide an update on our evolving environmental, social, and governance (ESG) framework.

GreenTech Innovations targets net-zero emissions by 2050, contingent on technological and economic feasibility (clause_001). Our roadmap integrates direct emissions reductions, efficiency gains, and carbon offsets. We will announce specific interim targets and timelines upon the completion of our current internal assessment (clause_002).

Regarding our value chain, we currently engage key suppliers on ESG alignment and intend to formalize these expectations as our sustainability program matures (clause_003). We remain focused on decoupling our rapid operational growth from our environmental footprint through cleaner energy adoption, balancing expansion with our long-term climate objectives (clause_004).

Please note that these forward-looking aspirations are not performance guarantees and remain subject to evolving market, regulatory, and technological variables (clause_005).

We look forward to sharing further milestones as we progress.

Best regards,

The GreenTech Innovations Management Team
