Since "Clause 001" is likely a placeholder for a specific provision in your term sheet, SAFE, or shareholders' agreement, the best way to resolve it depends on whether you are **proposing a change**, **seeking clarification**, or **reporting a milestone**.

Below are three templates based on the most common scenarios for resolving a specific clause.

### Option 1: Proactive Resolution (You have a plan)
*Use this if Clause 001 relates to a milestone, a pivot, or a governance change that you have already mapped out.*

**Subject:** Update: Resolution regarding [Clause 001 Name] / [Company Name]

Hi [Investor Name],

I hope you’re having a productive week.

I’m writing to provide a brief update regarding Clause 001 ([mention what the clause covers, e.g., the Board Composition or the Series A Milestone]) in our current agreement. 

To ensure we stay aligned with our growth targets for Q3, we are proposing to resolve this by [explain your solution, e.g., appointing the independent board member / hitting the $1M ARR target]. 

Our internal deadline for this is [Date]. We believe this move will [mention a benefit: streamline decision-making / unlock the next tranche of funding]. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you would like to hop on a quick 10-minute call to discuss this further.

Best,

[Your Name]

### Option 2: Seeking Advice (You want their input)
*Use this if Clause 001 is a point of friction or a legal "gray area" where you need investor buy-in.*

**Subject:** Seeking your input on [Clause 001/Provision Name]

Hi [Investor Name],

I’m currently reviewing Clause 001 ([Name of Clause]) of our agreement as we prepare for [upcoming event, e.g., the next bridge round].

Given your experience with [similar companies/market conditions], I wanted to get your perspective on how we should best satisfy this requirement. We are currently weighing two options:

1. [Option A]
2. [Option B]

I’d love to hear which approach you feel better protects the long-term interests of the company and its shareholders. Are you available for a brief chat on [Day] at [Time]?

### Option 3: Formal Waiver or Amendment
*Use this if Clause 001 is a restriction that you need the investor to "waive" or change.*

**Subject:** Formal Request: Amendment to Clause 001

Hi [Investor Name],

As we continue to scale [Company Name], we’ve identified a need to adjust Clause 001 ([Name of Clause]) to better reflect our current operational structure.

Specifically, we are requesting [describe the change: a waiver of the right of first refusal / an extension on the reporting deadline]. This change is necessary because [give a clear reason: it will allow us to close a strategic partnership faster].

I’ve attached a formal one-page amendment for your review. If this looks good to you, please let me know, and I’ll send it over via DocuSign.

Thanks for your continued support.

Best,

[Your Name]

### How to decide which to use?
*   **If Clause 001 is a "Condition Precedent" (Something you must do before getting money):** Use **Option 1** to show you are on top of it.
*   **If Clause 001 is a "Restrictive Covenant" (Something you aren't allowed to do):** Use **Option 3** to ask for permission to move past it.
*   **If Clause 001 is "Vague" (Definitions or interpretation):** Use **Option 2** to build rapport and avoid legal disputes later.

**Note:** If "Clause 001" refers to something highly sensitive (like founder vesting or liquidation preferences), it is always best to have a verbal conversation before sending the formal email.
