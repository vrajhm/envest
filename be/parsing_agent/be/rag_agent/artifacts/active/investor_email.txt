Subject: Update: Resolution of Sustainability Clauses 001-005

Email:
Dear [Contact Name],

We have finalized revisions for clauses 001 through 005 to address concerns regarding vague syntax and the lack of measurable commitments. The updated language replaces forward-looking statements with specific milestones for Net Zero 2040 and firm deadlines for Scope 3 reporting. We have also tightened requirements for renewable energy documentation and baseline recalculation transparency to improve the current trust score. Please review these rectified clauses to ensure alignment before we proceed to the next stage of the agreement.

Regards,

[Investor Name]
